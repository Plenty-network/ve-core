# Scenarios

Given below are some of the integral real-world scenarios or actions that could be performed on the PLY/vePLY system. Only dummy values are used in the examples. Refer to the official website for actual values/metrics.

- Swap existing **PLENTY** or **WRAP** tokens with **PLY** or associated **vePLY** tokens.
- Lock PLY tokens in **Vote-Escrow** (VE) Locker to get a vePLY NFT.
- Provide liquidity in the new set of AMMs (Stableswap & Uniswap v2 like).
- Stake the L.P tokens (generated by providing liquidity in the AMMs), in **Gauges**.
  - You receive PLY emissions by staking L.P tokens in Gauges.
  - You can boost your emission rate upto 2.5x by attaching a vePLY NFT to your stake.
- As a vePLY holder, vote on a weekly basis to decide the weekly emission distribution across Gauges of the AMMs.
  - You may claim a **Bribe** (a small reward in any random token) if you vote for a gauge that has been incentivised by a briber.
  - You would also receive a share of the fees collected by the AMM related to the gauge.
  - Your locked PLY value will increase proportionally to the inflation rate generated across the gauges, to prevent dilution.

## 1. Swap existing PLENTY or WRAP tokens with PLY or associated vePLY tokens

If you hold the existing PLENTY and/or WRAP tokens, you can exchange them for the tokens of the new system - after the merger. There will be predetermined exchange rates for both tokens. You would receive the new token PLY through a special form of vesting designed to work closely with the Ve(3, 3) system.

**Scenario:**

- You have 1000 PLENTY tokens (would work similarly for WRAP, with a different exchange rate).
- You deposit 1000 PLENTY into an **Exchange contract** and have 500 PLY tokens ‘assigned’ to you (dummy exchange rate of 0.5 PLY/PLENTY).
- You do not end up getting 500 PLY all at once like a standard swap, instead, you will have two options to retrieve the PLY assigned to you:
  - The PLY is initially locked and will keep getting unlocked at a rate of say 0.1 PLY/second (this is once again a dummy value). So, 60 seconds after the exchange, you can claim 6 PLY tokens. This can be thought of as vesting on a per-second basis.
  - You can also claim the part that is locked as a vePLY NFT. When you make such a ‘future’ claim, your PLY is sent to the Escrow Locker and **locked for a period of time** selected by you, and you receive a **transferable NFT** (that can be sold on a secondary market) representing the ownership of the underlying locked PLY.

## 2. Lock PLY tokens in Vote-Escrow (VE) Locker to get a vePLY NFT

You can lock your PLY tokens in the **Vote-Escrow Locker** to receive vePLY. The locking period is in number of integral weeks - 1 week, 2 weeks, so on with a max of 4 years (~ 208 weeks), depending upon how vested you are into the ecosystem.

**NOTE:** Lock ups are done on the basis of _whole weeks_. Each week starts at Thursday, 12 AM (UTC). Therefore, if you want to do a minimum time (1 week) lock up, say on Tuesday, you would essentially be locking your tokens for 1 week + 2 days (covering the Tuesday -> Thursday gap).

**vePLY** is essentially a transferable NFT that represents the ownership of the locked PLY and also has an associated ‘Voting Power’ that is **linearly decreasing** over time. The amount of the underlying PLY stays the same throughout the lock. Underlying PLY cannot be claimed until lock expiry. The locking explained in the Action 1 would work in a similar way.

**What can vePLY holders do?**

- Vote to decide the weekly PLY emission distribution across the Gauges of different AMM pools.
- Claim fees from the AMMs whose gauges they vote for.
- Claim bribes from incentivised votes.
- Additionally, they can have their underlying PLY grow proportionally to inflation that is being generated by the gauges.

**Voting Power Scenarios:**

- If you lock 1000 PLY tokens for 4 years, you get a vePLY NFT with an initial voting power of 1000.
- If you lock 1000 PLY tokens for 3 years, you get a vePLY NFT with an initial voting power of 750.
- In a similar way, you get a power of 500 for 2 years, 250 for 1 year and so on in a linearly related way. The higher your lock period, the higher your initial voting power.
- As mentioned before, this voting power also decreases constantly at the same linear rate. So, if you have 1000 PLY locked for 4 years and received a vePLY with initial voting power as 1000 - after a year, the voting power will be reduced to 750. By the end of the lock, the voting power would tend to zero.

**NOTE:** The vePLY holders can increase their underlying PLY value and also increase the lock period at anytime before expiry. The voting power is adjusted accordingly when either of the two operations are performed.

## 3. Provide liquidity in the new set of AMMs (Stableswap & Uniswap v2 like)

Liquidity provision across AMM pools would work in the standard way, with all providers receiving associated L.P tokens.

**AMM Fees:**

- For AMMs whose Gauges (explained in Point 4) are not receiving PLY emissions (i.e not whitelisted), the fees would go directly to the liquidity providers.
- For AMMs with gauges receiving the emission, the fees would not go directly to the L.Ps. Instead, the fees would be given to vePLY holders who voted for that gauge in that week (elaborated in Action 5).
- L.Ps can get vePLY by locking up the PLY emissions they receive from the Gauges.

## 4. Stake the L.P tokens (generated by providing liquidity in the AMMs) in Gauges

Every AMM Pool in the new system will have an associated **Gauge** that would act as a **farm** for weekly PLY emissions. Liquidity Providers in the AMMs can stake their LP tokens in the Gauges to receive a share of the emission.

The L.P token stakers can also ‘boost’ or increase their total share of the weekly emission to a maximum of **2.5x**, by attaching a vePLY NFT to their stake. The total boost would depend on the spot voting power of the vePLY.

## 5. As a vePLY holder, vote on a weekly basis to decide the weekly emission distribution across Gauges

The main perk of being a vePLY holder is that you can vote on the distribution of weekly PLY emissions across the Gauges. The distribution is calculated based on the voting power you assign to each gauge during the voting period.

Voting is in an ‘always-on’ state, results are factored in and gauge weights are adjusted on a fixed day every week.
vePLY holders receive AMM fees only for those whose Gauges they vote for. **It is required to vote in a week in order to receive the fees for that week.**

**Scenario for Voting:**

Assume there are three AMM pools - kUSD, USDtz, uUSD (Second pair-token is Ctez in all cases). Each one has an associated gauge.

There are 3 vePLY holders with following voting powers:

| Holder | Voting Power |
| ------ | ------------ |
| Alice  | 4,000        |
| Bob    | 3,500        |
| John   | 2,500        |

The vote distribution across a certain week is:

| Pool  | Alice's Votes | Bob's Votes | John's Votes | Total Votes | Percentage Allocation of Votes |
| ----- | ------------- | ----------- | ------------ | ----------- | ------------------------------ |
| kUSD  | 2,000         | 2,500       | 0            | 4,500       | 45%                            |
| USDtz | 2,000         | 1,000       | 0            | 3,000       | 30%                            |
| uUSD  | 0             | 0           | 2,500        | 2,500       | 25%                            |

If the PLY inflation for the current week is **150,000 PLY**, the distribution across gauges based on vote allocation would be as follows:

| Pool Gauge | PLY Allocation |
| ---------- | -------------- |
| kUSD       | 67,500         |
| USDtz      | 45,000         |
| uUSD       | 37500          |

The fees will be distributed amongst voters in the ratio of their individual vote allocation for an AMM pool. In our example that would be:

| Pool  | Alice's allocation | Bob's Allocation | John's Allocation |
| ----- | ------------------ | ---------------- | ----------------- |
| kUSD  | 44.4%              | 55.6%            | 0%                |
| USDtz | 66.67%             | 33.33%           | 0%                |
| uUSD  | 0%                 | 0%               | 100%              |

Votes for AMM pools can also be incentivised by giving bribes to those who vote for emissions through the gauge. The bribe reward is distributed based on the voting share, similar to the distribution of fees.
