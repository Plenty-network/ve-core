# Plenty's PLY/vePLY System

Much of the growth of DeFi has been fuelled by liquidity mining. Many protocols have incentivized liquidity for their native token through token emissions. While itâ€™s important for a token to have deep liquidity, these programs have often been taken to the extreme to attract yield farmers, resulting in inflation rates, leading to perpetual sell-pressure on the underlying token.

The PLY/vePLY system better aligns the emission of tokens to beneficial actions and solve the problem with current Automated Market Maker (AMM) designs where liquidity provision is temporarily subsidized while fees generation, the more sustainable incentives-generating mechanism, is not.
